# MTL-QSAR
This repository has the Java source code for MTL-QSAR paper **Multi-Task Learning with a Natural Metric for Quantitative Structure
  Activity Relationship Learning**
  
The datasets used in this experiments are available on https://www.openml.org/s/3

Please download the datasets and similarity values available on google drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WCQWIe7wlVfQ7vbwZgHXQy3YDRAPMUte?usp=sharing

Unzip the ECFP6_1024.zip file and make sure the resulting folder replaces the empty folder ECFP6_1024/ which is inside MTL-QSAR/ project folder

Also, unzip the ChEMBL20.zip file and make sure the resulting folder replaces the empty folder ChEMBL20/ which is inside MTL-QSAR/ project folder. The ChEMBL20/ folder contains the ChEMBL groups and classes of drug targets as explained in the paper. It also includes the similarity values of drug targets and the sequences used to compute these similarity values.
